#Reminders:

-If your app screen is currently inside app.tsx please make a separate tsx file named (screenname).tsx

-Please upload all your screens in pages folder inside src/components

-Please only clone repository right after all screens are added for essential fixes <3.

-After all the screens are added by all group members, please clone repository.

-Duplicate the repository so changes of your own files should only be applied locally and when changes are finalized,
 copy and paste new code inside the repo clone to push changes.
 
 ex:
  bang_frontend(repository) - (dont npm install)
  
  bang_frontend_mycopy(duplicate of repository) - npm install here. 
                                                  Change shit here, for local shit and avoid errors 
                                                  (All testings and changes should be done here)
                                                  (After ma finalize nimo imong changes copy and paste sa repository jud mismo and push)
                                                  for example naa kay image files:
                                                  add it first sa imo local na copy and 
                                                  if ever mo work na upload your images na sa repository na files.
